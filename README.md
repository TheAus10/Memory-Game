# Memory-Game

*app is currently in review for the Google Play Store

### Overview
This application was developed using Android Studio and Google's Firebase.
An Android application for a multi-player version of the classic card game, Memory. Multi-player functionality was created using the Realtime Database from Firebase. Players take turns flipping cards and looking for matching images. Once a match is found, the cards disappear and the players score increases. Once all the cards are gone, the player with the highest score is the winner. There is also a single player mode with three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. Each mode doubles the number of images, and the images also become more similar, making it harder to find matches. 

### Multiplayer
When on the Multiplayer Menu, the user is prompted with the option to `Create a Game` or `Join a Game`.
